# Repository overview for AI coding agents

This repository is a small MERN-style learning project. The current, discoverable surface:

- Backend: `Backend/` — an Express + Mongoose API using ES modules.
- Frontend: `Frontend/` — present but empty in this snapshot.
- Root: a plain text file named starting with `bharathbanakar954_db_user=` which appears to contain DB credentials; treat as a secret and do not leak values.

Key files (source of truth)

- `Backend/src/server.js` — app bootstrap. Uses `dotenv`, calls `connectDB()`, and mounts routes at `/app/notes`.
- `Backend/src/config/db.js` — exports `connectDB()`; reads `process.env.MONGO_URI` and calls `mongoose.connect()`.
- `Backend/src/routes/notesRoutes.js` — Express Router mapping HTTP verbs to controller functions.
- `Backend/src/controllers/notesController.js` — named exports for `getAllNotes`, `createNotes`, `updateNotes`, `deleteNotes` (simple stub implementations currently).
- `Backend/src/models/Note.js` — Mongoose schema & default export `Note` (uses `{ timestamps: true }`).
- `Backend/package.json` — `type: "module"`, scripts: `start` (node) and `test` (nodemon running the server).

Architecture & why it matters

- Single-process API: the backend is a small Express server intended as the API layer only. There is no frontend build in this repo snapshot.
- ES modules are enabled (`type: "module"`), so use `import` / `export` consistently.
- DB connectivity is centralized via `connectDB()` so controllers assume an active mongoose connection.
- Routes are mounted under the `/app/notes` prefix — e.g., `GET /app/notes/` hits `getAllNotes()`.

Development workflow (explicit commands)

- Start development with live reload (nodemon): `npm run test` from `Backend/` (note: this project uses `test` to run nodemon).
- Start production-like server: `npm start` from `Backend/`.
- Ensure environment variables exist: create a `.env` in `Backend/` with `MONGO_URI` (and optional `PORT`). The server logs `process.env.MONGO_URI` on startup — avoid committing secrets.

Project-specific conventions and patterns

- Module style: ES modules. Prefer `import`/`export` over CommonJS.
- Controllers: export named functions (not default). Routes import them as named imports.
- Models: default export the Mongoose model (see `Note.js`).
- Router mount point: `app.use('/app/notes', notesRoutes)` — new resource routers should follow the same pattern and be mounted in `server.js`.
- Error handling: `connectDB()` logs and `process.exit(1)` on failure — callers rely on process termination for unrecoverable DB errors.

Integration points & sensitive files

- MongoDB: configured via `process.env.MONGO_URI` and used by `mongoose`.
- The root file `bharathbanakar954_db_user=NF8uFlI4C.txt` appears to contain DB credentials; treat as sensitive. Do not print or expose its contents in PRs or outputs.

How to extend the API (example)

1. Add a model file under `Backend/src/models/` (use default export of mongoose model).
2. Add controller functions in `Backend/src/controllers/` as named exports.
3. Create a router in `Backend/src/routes/`, map paths to controllers, and `export default router`.
4. Mount the router in `Backend/src/server.js` with `app.use('/app/<resource>', <router>)`.

Small code examples from this repo

- Route: `GET /app/notes/` -> `Backend/src/routes/notesRoutes.js` uses `router.get('/', getAllNotes)`.
- Model: `Note` schema includes `title` and `content` and uses timestamps: see `Backend/src/models/Note.js`.

Recommended agent behaviors (practical, repo-specific)

- Use ES module syntax in any generated code.
- Never echo or commit literal values from files whose names look like credentials (e.g., files containing `db_user` or `MONGO_URI`). If you need values for testing, prompt the developer.
- Prefer small, focused changes: add a new route + controller + test file for each feature rather than editing many unrelated files.
- When suggesting startup commands, reference `Backend/package.json` scripts and the `Backend/` path explicitly.

If anything is unclear or you want examples (new route, model, or a sample `.env`), tell me which area to expand.
